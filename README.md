# textwrite
The free, open source, text based text editor. Reimagined, in JavaScript.

**How to run me?**

Just download into a folder, **cd** in the terminal to that folder, then run **node tw.js**

#### What does it do?

Once you've run __node tw.js__, it will create a textwrite server at 127.0.0.1:1560, and one at 127.0.0.1:7650 - both exactly the same. You can then add whatever you want to your textwrite.tw file, and it will show up at the two above IPs (restart required). The textwrite.tw file is HTML formatting, so line breaks can be made using \<br>.
