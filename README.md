# textwrite
The free, open source, text based text editor. Reimagined, in JavaScript.

#### How to run me? (js version)

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.org)

Just download into a folder, **cd** in the terminal to that folder, then run **npm test**, then **npm start** if all goes well

#### What does it do?

Once you've run __npm start__, it will create a textwrite server at 127.0.0.1:1560. You can then add whatever you want to your textwrite.tw file, and it will show up at the two above IPs *automatically*. The textwrite.tw file is HTML, so line breaks can be made using \<br>.
